# Introduction

Over the summer of 2024 I alongside  began an investigation into 2 questions posed by our academic supervisor.

1. Find a complete characterisation of $\mathrm{Aut}S_n$, including the special cases of $n = 2,6$.

2. Describe the group $\mathrm{Aut}S_n^{\pm}$, where $S_n^\pm = \left\{ \alpha(a) = \alpha(-a) \mid \alpha \in S_{\{-n, -(n-1), \dots, -1, 1, \dots, n-1, n\}} \right\}$.

Throughout the project, we discovered a representation of $S_n^\pm$ as a (finite permutational restricted) wreath product $S_n^\pm = C_m \wr_n S_n$. Following this more questions arose: 

1. What is the minimal generating set of $S_n^\pm$, and by extension of $C_m \wr S_n$.

2. What is the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}C_m \wr S_n$.
