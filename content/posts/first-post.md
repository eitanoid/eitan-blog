# Starting a Blog

Recently, I decided to start a blog to document my thoughts and decisions throughout my various projects and interests. 
I’ve often found that looking at finished products doesn’t fully capture the reasoning and problem-solving process behind them.
By writing things down, I hope to create a useful reference for myself while also sharing insights with anyone who might find them interesting.

### Mathematics
I am currently studying for a Masters degree in Mathematics at the University of York, with strong interests in Analysis, Algebra, Computation, and Finance.
I explore these topics through of my coursework, research, and personal projects.

### Computing
I primarily program in `Go` and `Python`, with experience in `Bash`, `Lua`, `R` and `Maple`. I am also interested in learning `C` and `C++`.
My main areas of interest include computational mathematics, data science, and image specifications such as JPEG.
I am a Linux user, currently running Fedora 41 on my personal computer.

### Coffee
As a regular coffee drinker, I enjoy the science behind growing, processing, brewing, and roasting. 
I’ve dabbled in home roasting in the past using a Hive Sample Roaster, and appreciate the complexities and precision involved.

## Reading List
I plan to use this blog to track my reading list—both academic and personal. 
This will include books and papers related to coffee, mathematics, computing, and other topics that interest me.

## The Blog Set Up

I'm running this blog using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static-site generator.
This setup provides a nice balance between control, featuers and convenience. 
It allows me to write without worrying about unnecessary complexity while still supporting useful features such as `TeX` for mathematical notation.
