### Introduction

Over the summer of 2024 I alongside  began an investigation into 2 questions posed by our academic supervisor.

1. Find a complete characterisation of $\mathrm{Aut}S_n$, including the special cases of $n = 2,6$.

2. Describe the group $\mathrm{Aut}S_n^{\pm}$, where: 
$$S_n^\pm = \\{ \alpha(a) = \alpha(-a) \mid \alpha \in S_{2N}\\} $$
and
$$2N = \\{-n, \\; -(n-1),\\; \dots, -1,\\; 1, \\; \dots n-1,\\; n\\}$$

Throughout the project, we re-discovered a representation of $S_n^\pm$ as a semi-direct product, and later discovering it's wreath product representation as: $S_n^\pm = C_m \wr_n S_n$. Following this more questions arose: 

1. What is the minimal generating set of $S_n^\pm$, and by extension of $C_2 \wr S_n$. For $S_N$ This answer is known to be $2$.

2. What is the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}C_m \wr S_n$? How far can we generalise this?
