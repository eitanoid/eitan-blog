## Research
***
In addition to the the course itself, I have also worked on the following: 

<!-- ### Summer 2024 Automorphism Research Project -->
<!-- *** -->
<!-- - Collaborated on an open ended Abstract Algebra project with the goal of characterising the automorphism groups of $S_n$ and $C_2 \wr_n S_n$, as well as other characterisations of the groups. -->

### Cyber Security Society Talks:
***
- Online Fingerprinting, Finger Prints and the FBI's Wavelet Scalar Specification.
- Image Watermarking and Steganography, common applications, methods and attacks.
